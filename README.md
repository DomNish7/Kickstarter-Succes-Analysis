# Kickstarter-Success-Analysis

As my final project for my data analytics bootcamp, I was tasked to find a dataset and utilized Python to analyze the data. My mentor told me to go as big as possible and I chose a dataset about Kickstarter Projects containing approximately 375K projects with varing statuses.

The repository contains how I tried to determine any correlated variables on most impactful sectors of project classification. I have also provided the link to the final presentation that I put together in Tableau
